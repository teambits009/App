- Save credit/debit cards, loyalty cards, and transit passes
- Securely hold health records (vaccination cards, prescriptions, etc.)
- Manage and send/receive cryptocurrencies or tokenized assets
- Use biometric authentication for all sensitive actions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Area | Tech |
|------|------|
| Mobile App | Flutter (iOS & Android) |
| Identity Layer | Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials |
| Blockchain | Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana (pluggable) |

## 🔐 Security Model

- **Data Ownership**: All user data is stored locally by default. Cloud backup is encrypted with user-generated keys only they control.
- **No Central Servers**: Authentication and ID verification happen via decentralized protocols (DIDComm, VC/VP frameworks).
- **Open Source**: Transparency first. Anyone can inspect the code and audit the security model.
