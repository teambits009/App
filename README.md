## 📆 Tech Stack

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Mobile App | Flutter (iOS/Android) |
| Blockchain | Ethereum, Polygon, Solana (pluggable) |
| Identity | DIDs, Verifiable Credentials (W3C) |

## 🛡️ Security Model

- **Local-First**: All sensitive data is stored and encrypted on the device by default
- **User-Owned Encryption Keys**: Keys are generated on-device and never leave the user’s control
- **No Central Servers**: Verification via decentralized protocols (DIDComm, VC exchanges)
- **Auditability**: Entire stack is open-source and auditable
